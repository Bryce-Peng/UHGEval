# ðŸ’¡ UHGEval

Benchmarking the Hallucination of Chinese Large Language Models via Unconstrained Generation

* Safety: Ensuring the security of experimental data is of utmost importance.
* Flexibility: Easily expandable, with all modules replaceable.

## Quick Start

Get started quickly with a 20-line demo program.

* UHGEval requires Python>=3.10.0
* `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Take `uhgeval/configs/example_config.py` as an example, create `uhgeval/configs/real_config.py` to configure the OpenAI GPT section.
* Run `demo.py`

## Advanced Usage

Utilize run_uhgeval.py or run_uhgeval_future.py for a comprehensive understanding of this project. The former is currently a provisional piece of code slated for removal in the future; whereas the latter is command-line executable code intended for future use.
